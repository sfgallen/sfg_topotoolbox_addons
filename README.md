Sean's TopoToolbox add ons

A series of codes in various states that I've written and use or have used to help with analyses conducted using TopoToolbox.

Some of the codes are really easy to use and have help menus and error handling. Others are poorly commented, and some might not work as intended, so use at your own risk.
